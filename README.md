"all the world's a stage..."

Internet of Things apps often reference a hierarchy of things which may be viewed independently or as collections.

While a classic Master List/Detail View pattern may suffice for simple collections, 
the navigation drawer pattern has advantages in scaling & organizing the collections.

Short range goals:
- establish framework for creating, updating, removing, associating & navigating a dynamic object hierarchy
- establish Google Firebase as repository for securely sharing the object hierarchy
- establish several local services shared within app
- explore stage models
- exercise synchronized, concurrent & free form story execution

Mid-range goals:
- establish Google Firebase for notification, invitations, messaging, etc.  
- generate Google Firebase performance metrics
- evaluate impact of edge intelligence (cloud repository with no logic)
(Human Interaction)
- enable voice control to replace keyboard (audibility)
- enable audio recognition of objects (audibility)
- establish alternate representations of object vs text based attributes (visualibility)
- establish framework for record/playback
- explore gesture/voice interaction

Long-range goals:
- mirror gestures/voice comands on tablet to Virtual Reality engine (e.g. Galaxy phone)
- evaluate framework for Augmented Reality apps
- evaluate story execution vs IFTTT style scripting
- explore framework migration to a thing (e.g. Rapsberry Pi running AndroidThings?)
- enable ML analysis of story outcomes
